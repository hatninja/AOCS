# AOS3
This is a Attorney Online 2 server written in pure lua using luasocket.


### Set-up
Note that this project is still in an early state, and is not ready to be used outside of development.

Lua can be typically installed using a package manager. Windows users may find it easier to use this [prebuilt luasocket release](http://files.luaforge.net/releases/luasocket/luasocket/luasocket-2.0.2).

__Running:__
1. Clone the source to any location.
2. Rename the folder "Config" to be lowercase "config"
3. Run using the shell script `run.sh`, or with lua directly on `init.lua`

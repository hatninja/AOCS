This is a chat server written in pure lua with the help of [luasocket](https://aiq0.github.io/luasocket/index.html). It is intended for use with [AO2](https://github.com/AttorneyOnline), and supports basic roleplay features.

AOCS aims to create a simplified server experience, with a focus on few but high-quality features. For a more fully-featured server, check out the previous [AOLS2](https://github.com/hatninja/AOLS2).
